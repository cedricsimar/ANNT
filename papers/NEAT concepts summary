Force minimal topologies: we use 2)
1) incorporate network size into the fitness function but not easy to know how large the penalty should be because different problems may have significantly different topological requirements
2) starting out with a minimal population and growing structure from there is a design principle in NEAT.

The goal is not to minimize only the final product, but all intermediate networks along the way as well -> minimize the search space
Problem: without initial topological diversity, topological innovations would not survive
-> speciating the population in NEAT solves this problem
